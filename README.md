# Big Volume Energy

BVE is a cryptocurrency price and volume ticker/tracker with alerts.

## Usage

Simply type in your desired coin pairs without any spaces, dashes or slashes (ex. "BTCUSDT") and turn it on.\
BVE will show the current price and 24hr change as a ticker. It will also update and show the volume flow for every set interval (default 1 minute), and compare it to the average volume flow for the past 3 hours.\
Whenever the current volume flow is higher than the average volume flow by your desired amount (default 40%), BVE will play a sound alert and show each event in the notifications dropdown. You can also turn off the sound if you wish and just receive the notifications.\
\
Currently it receives the price and volume data from Binance.com only.
